;;; emacs-http.el --- minimal HTTP/1.1 server layer over make-network-process -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 zawatton + Claude

;; This file is part of nelisp-emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; The HTTP protocol layer the socket substrate was missing.  The real
;; TCP accept/serve substrate already exists (`make-network-process'
;; with `:server', backed by the syscall FFI in `emacs-network-ffi.el'
;; / `emacs-process-events.el'); what did not exist was a way to speak
;; HTTP over it.  This module is that layer, and only that layer:
;;
;;   pure, no sockets (fully unit-testable):
;;     `emacs-http-parse-request'   raw bytes -> request plist (or partial)
;;     `emacs-http-request-header'  case-insensitive header lookup
;;     `emacs-http-build-response'  status + headers + body -> raw bytes
;;
;;   adapter, over make-network-process:
;;     `emacs-http-serve'           bind a port, dispatch each complete
;;                                  request to a handler, write its reply
;;     `emacs-http-stop'            tear a server down
;;
;; A handler takes the request plist and returns a response plist
;; (:status :headers :body); the serve loop turns that into bytes and
;; closes the connection (HTTP/1.0-style Connection: close, which is all
;; the web-product substrate needs and keeps per-connection state
;; trivial).  Requests are accumulated per-connection until Content-Length
;; bytes have arrived, so a body split across TCP segments still parses.
;;
;; Dual-target: pure Elisp on top of `make-network-process', which is
;; native under host Emacs and polyfilled under NeLisp standalone.  A
;; `emacs-http-max-request-bytes' cap bounds memory per connection
;; (input-size hardening).
